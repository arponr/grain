# Memory

It's clear that *Cat's Eye* has a lot to do with memory: how memories are repressed and how they resurface, how memories affect or interfere with your identity, and more generally how the past intrudes on the present.

This intrusion is built into the text's form. Most of the story is told as memories; this is distinct from flashback primarily in that we are almost always in the present-tense. Moreover, the memories are given as memories come in reality, in discontinuous blocks in the midst of the present narrative. The memories are come to us chronologically, but where they are given, i.e. when they are remembered, is often no accident. Memories of Mrs. Smeath run into descriptions of Elaine's paintings of Mrs. Smeath, memories of Jon run into Elaine's present meeting with Jon. All of this is extremely e/affective: it really does evoke the sensation of memory, and intimates the complex interactions of past and present. In fact, sometimes we are given explicit and jarring transitions from past- to present-tense; one example that comes to mind is the (tragic) description of Stephen's death near the end of the book.

Another notable intrusion of the past on the present in the novel is Elaine's hallucination of (presumably) Cordelia's nine-year-old voice, when it seems Jon has abanonded Sarah and her, the voice goading Elaine to slit her wrist. This is symbolic: Elaine's past literally almost kills her.
