Lucy's guide/intro to reading *Pride and Prejudice* (from 2016-01-12, all quoted):


ok I tell you how to read

here are like important themes
- prejudiceeeee
- ironyyyyy
- free indirect speechhhh
- marriage and money vs love

economic concerns are super important in austen

novel of manners -- aka they live in a society where manners / rules of conduct are really rigid and well defined

that this novel was written/published in the time of french revolution / napoleon
and that austen is a traditionalist

- the importance of wit and laughter
- the lack of physical descriptions (of clothing or people), and how any such descriptions supplied function in a moral way
- the lack of character thoughts! we essentially only get direct speech, except sometimes we get FIS into elizabeth's head (this is like a jwood development of consciousness in the novel point)

austen essentially pioneers the modern novel and helps elevate its status

the novel starts developing as a form in like the 1700s, but at the time, it's most in "epistolary form" aka it'll just be like a collection of letters (like the color purple), so everything you read will be a direct thought / speech uttered by characters. at the time also, novels were considered a lesser art form than poetry (which was formal and masculine)!

oh LETTERS are also super important throughout austen

oh and this isn't a plot point or anything, but I was super confused by it. whenever they say "Miss [surname]," that refers to the OLDEST daughter only. 

thus in p&p, "Miss Bennet" refers exclusively to Jane Bennet. Elizabeth and the other sisters are always addressed as "Miss Elizabeth Bennet"

also the "entail" is a super important plot point, so you should read that footnote

also important I guess: austen was traditionally considered a masculine writer, because she dealt with themes such as economic concerns and upholding tradition. british soldiers read her novels in the trenches! churchill took her novels with him to his underground bunker! it wasn't until the BBC and Hollywood came in and misappropriated her novels for romantic movies in the 1990s that all of a sudden austen became a women's writer
