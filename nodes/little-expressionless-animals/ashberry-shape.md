Both David Foster Wallace's short story "Little Expressionless Animals" and Ben Lerner's novel *Leaving the Atocha Station* refer to the following line from John Ashberry's poem "Self-Portrait In A Convex Mirror": "Like a wave breaking on a rock, giving up // Its shape in a gesture which expresses that shape."

I think both works are using this line to suggest in some way that to have a true meaningful self it is necessary to let go of one's notion of self.

In "Little Expressionless Animals" the line (referred to on p. 42) works to expose the main character's selfishness and inability to empathize or recognize the full three-dimensional humanity of others. (See the notes on "The geometry of 'Little Expressionless Animals'" for the fleshing out of this idea.)

In *Leaving the Atocha Station* the line (referred to on p. 146)
