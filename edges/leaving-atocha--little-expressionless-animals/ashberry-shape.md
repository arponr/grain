Both "Little Expressionless Animals" and *Atocha* refer to the following lines from John Ashberry's poem "Self-Portrait In A Convex Mirror":

> Like a wave breaking on a rock, giving up
> Its shape in a gesture which expresses that shape.

I think in both works the lines are used to suggest in some way the necessity of giving up one's notion of self.

In "Little Expressionless Animals", the main character is unable to recognize others as truly distinct humans, with their own complete sets of thoughts and feelings not necessarily related to her own. In other words she can't empathize, in particular with her mom and lover, and this inability to escape herself is responsible for a great deal of her confusion and pain. (See the notes on the geometry of "Little Expressionless Animals" for more.)

In *Atocha*, the main character is trappers within layers and layers of self-awareness and vanity, and constantly feels fradulent and worthless. The text suggests that one needs to embrace the impossibility of authenticity, i.e. give up on the notion of the authentic self, just as one embraces the acts of translation and interpretation of poetry/literature. (See the notes on authenticity and plurality in *Atocha* for more.)
