Two striking lines from the open section of *Infinite Jest*:

- "I am in here." 
- "I'm in here. ... I am not what you see and hear."

And a striking line from *Atocha*, first quoted as part of one of Adam's poems:

> I have never been here.
> Understand?
> You have never seen me. [p. 128]

And again later given within Adam's narrative: "I have never been here, I said to myself. You have never seen me." [p. 178].

I'm fairly sure this is an explicit reference from *Atocha* to *Infinite Jest*, but I can't be sure of course. In both texts these lines are the main characters (Hal and Adam) attempting to express that the outside world cannot see their authentic selves, that they are unable to communicate or interact faithfully with the world.

Interestingly, both texts also center themselves around drug-use. The opening scene of *Infinite Jest* has Hal's inner self extremely disconnected from what the outside world perceives, and it's intimated that this has to do with his taking the DMZ or his ingestion of the weird mushroom as a kid (or probably both). And Adam's chronic drug usage is a big part of his distance from himself and the world around him.

Note also that the opening section of *Infinite Jest* has Hal trying to calculate a bunch of facial expressions, in dealing with his "condition", just as Adam does throughout *Atocha*.

For more, see the notes on transcendence in *Infinite Jest* and on authenticity and plurality in *Atocha*.
